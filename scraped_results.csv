https://www.freewillsolutions.com/javadeveloper,REJECT,HIGH,"Candidate's frontend stack (React) does not match the job's required frontend stack (Vue.js/Nuxt.js). The job is a pure Java Developer role with no AI/Data Engineering component, making the candidate's Master's in AI irrelevant for this position. Additionally, there is no indication of F-1 visa sponsorship in the job description, which the candidate requires."
https://morganstanley.eightfold.ai/careers/job/549794716786,REJECT,HIGH,"The job is for a ""Java Developer"" and does not indicate an ""AI/Data Engineering match,"" which is a required condition for submission. While the candidate's Java skills align and Morgan Stanley is generally visa-friendly, the explicit AI/Data Engineering match criterion for the job itself is not met."
https://www.capgemini.com/jobs/373619-en_GB+sap_btp/,SUBMIT,HIGH,"Capgemini explicitly lists ""Data and artificial intelligence"" as a core service and ""AI"" as a ""Hot topic,"" aligning perfectly with the candidate's Master's in AI. As a large global IT consulting firm, Capgemini is highly likely to have roles requiring Java/React full-stack skills and to be visa-friendly for specialized talent. No specific job requirements for defense/government, clearance, or citizenship are present in the provided general careers page."
